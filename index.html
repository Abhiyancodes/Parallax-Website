         <h2>FORESTS</h2>
         <p>Forests are home to some of our planet's most extraordinary biodiversity. They are also essential in the fight against climate change. But the world's forests are under threat from deforestation, logging and the impacts of Global Warming.Forests around the world also help to stabilize the climate. They do this by absorbing almost one-third of the carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels every year-around 2.6 billion tonnes.Because forests also store carbon, deforestation releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p>

    <h2>MOUNTAINS</h2>
    <p>Mountains are the world's “water towers,” providing 60-80% of all freshwater resources for our planet. At least half of the world's population depends on mountain ecosystem services to survive - not only water but also food and clean energy.Mountains attract around 20% of global tourism, host nearly one-quarter of all terrestrial biodiversity, and are home to many of the foods that come to our tables, such as rice, potatoes, tomatoes, and barley. </p>

    <h2>RIVERS</h2>
    <p>It goes without saying, but fresh, clean water is essential for humans and nature to survive. Rivers are precious sources of fresh drinking water for people across the world. Freshwater habitats account for some of the richest biodiversity in the world, and rivers are a vital, vibrant ecosystem for many species. People depend on rivers for their way of life and their livelihoods. From fishing to agriculture, the way we manage our waterways has a direct impact on people's lives.  </p>
